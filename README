Bayesian Deep Learning - HW1

In order to run this code: 

1. Install requirements with: pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run the script with: python gp.py

Note that plots will be saved to the working directory as gp_plot*.png

The only non-standard requirement is scikit-learn, which has a utility 
for computing pairwise Euclidean distances used in the project.
